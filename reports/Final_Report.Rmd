## Introduction
Predicting words is a task that can help a user when writing text on a mobile phone.
With small displays it can be cumbersome and lengthy to write texts.


## Development of the app
In the app we provide two models that are based on n-grams


## Used language models



## Future extensions
For the future several extensions could be implemented to enhance the app:

* Add additional languages for predicting words.
* Use neural net approach instead of the classical n-gram-based algorithms. A first alpha test is given [here](http://www.schelberts.de/shinyapps/lstm_text_predict) (unfortunately does not work directly on shinyapps.io).
* Allow for character prediction for partially typed words. This could be achieved via the neural net mentioned above.
* Auto-correct for mistyped words.
* Implement swiping techniques for mobile devices.
* Your idea to make this app more awesome...
